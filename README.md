# Hell Heart Internal Code

Basically what pre-optimization does to a Godot project. Using a Multimesh to batch the Bullet Sprites together, a grid-raycasting system to allow the player to shoot a certain type of enemy bullet ('Press F once.') by utilising Digital Differential Analysis and checking for collisions. Was previously using Pooling, though people kept pointing out that pooling is practically useless with current Engines. There is a MapMechanics class that replicated FF14 mechanics such as Fields, Push Mechanicxs or directional AOEs(using Dotproduct and such) along with some Shader Programming for visual flair.
Most of my uploades are like a Digital Scrapjard, so you can look through them and see if there is anything you can copy for your own Projects.
